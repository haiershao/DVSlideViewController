## Getting started

DVSlideViewController includes a demo application, showing how to create and configure an DVSlideViewController.

Essentially, DVSlideViewContoller is a UIViewController subclass.

The files you'll need to copy into your own project are in the 'DVSlideViewController' group in the Xcode project.

1. Add `QuartzCore.framework` to your target
2. Add `DVSlideViewController.h`, `DVSlideViewController.m` and `grayBackground.png` to your project

You also need to include QuartzCore to your project.
The remaining files in the Xcode project are included for demonstration purposes only.

## Working with DVSlideViewController

```objective-c
//DVSlideViewController
- (void)setViewController:(NSArray *)_viewControllers;
- (void)nextViewController;
- (void)prevViewController;
```

If you add `DVSlideViewController.h` to your childViewController `self.slideViewController` will become available.
